# How to run

### Requirements
- darts & flutter installed (check the working version below)

### Works in
- On local only
- Dart SDK version: 
    - 2.16.1 (stable)
- Flutter
    - 3.7.7

### How to run
1. Go to the cheezu directory
``` 
cd cheezu
```
2. Install required packages
```
dart pub get
```
3. Run the app on your device
```
flutter run
```
4. Log in as patient or caretaker (currently patient account is hardcoded as Jeff for username and password while caretaker account is hardcoded as Marcy for both)
5. When prompted for destination, use the search function to set it. Currently the search function will only display results in Japan since that's where the starting point is set (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan to be specific).
